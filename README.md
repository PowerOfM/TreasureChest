TreasureChest
=============

The TreasureChest plugin for CraftBukkit

Created ENTIRELY by Mtihc. I only updated the plugin to CB1.7.9. The plugin DOES NOT use UUIDs, but should still be completely stable. I may write a UUID converter to update configuration files that people may already have.

The jar file is provided as a courtesy. If you would prefer, compile your own! (:

If anyone can help with the UUID migration, please feel free to Fork mine or the original from Mtihc.
